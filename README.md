A web-based calorie calculator that estimates daily caloric needs based on the Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) formula. This application allows users to input their height, weight, age, and gender to get an accurate estimation of their daily caloric requirements.

## üìã Overview

This project provides a simple yet effective web-based calorie calculator based on the Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) formula. It allows users to input their height, weight, age, and gender to estimate their daily caloric needs.

## ‚ú® Features

- **BMR Calculation**: Calculates BMR based on user-provided height, weight, age, and gender using standard formulas
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides an intuitive HTML form for users to input their data
- **Clear Output**: Displays the calculated daily caloric needs in a clear, easy-to-understand format
- **Error Handling**: Handles invalid gender inputs and other potential errors gracefully
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Python**: Backend logic and API development
- **Flask**: Web framework for creating the API
- **HTML**: Structure and content of the web pages
- **CSS**: Styling and visual presentation of the web pages

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.6+**: Download from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **pip**: Python package installer (usually included with Python installations)

## üöÄ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Blazehue/Calorie_Calculator.git
   cd Calorie_Calculator
   ```

2. **Navigate to the `api` directory**:
   ```bash
   cd api
   ```

3. **Install Flask**:
   ```bash
   pip install Flask
   ```

## üìñ Usage

1. **Run the Flask application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   This will start the development server. The default address is usually `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

2. **Access the application in your web browser**:
   Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

3. **Enter your details**:
   Fill in the height, weight, age, and gender fields in the form.

4. **Click "Calculate"**:
   The calculated daily caloric needs will be displayed on the page.

## üì° API Documentation

The application provides a simple API with the following routes:

### `GET /`
Renders the `index.html` template, displaying the home page with the input form.

### `POST /calculate`
Receives user input from the form (height, weight, age, gender), calculates the BMR, and returns the result as an HTML heading.

**Request Body (form data)**:
- `height`: Height in centimeters (float)
- `weight`: Weight in kilograms (float)
- `age`: Age in years (integer)
- `gender`: Gender ('male' or 'female')

**Response**:
Returns an HTML string containing the calculated daily caloric needs (e.g., `<h1>Your daily caloric needs are approximately 1500.00 kcal</h1>`) or an error message if there are any issues.
